# Creature Type Generator For MTG

## Description

This program has two versions, one is a simple command line version, and a version with a UI designed using Kivy. Both use the same basic program to get a random creature type from the creature-types.txt file.

The intent of the project is to make a program that can be used on a mobile device, whether through an android application or hosting the application online to access via a web browser on any device.
