# Creature Type Generator For MTG

## Description

This is a simple random generator for all the creature types in MTG. It has been made specifically for use alongside a changelings only commander deck.

Example use case: "I play Herald's Horn naming *presses button* DRAGON. And because this Bloodline Pretender IS OF COURSE a DRAGON, I cast it for 1 less."

Should this application be requested by anyone for me to make publicly available at all times I will endeavor to make that happen.

## Web Application Version

This is the main version of the app named "app.py". This version of the application is a web application with the frontend and backend connected via flask. The current version is able to be up and running easily. The purpose of doing it this way is to use the python application I built on mobile devices. And I will be using this project as a learning experience and a reference for future projects.
